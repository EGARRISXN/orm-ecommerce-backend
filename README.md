## Technologies

1. Node.js

3. Mysql
4. Sequelize

## Installation

_Note: MySQL must be installed and running locally on your machine. Also, the server must have access to the `ecommerce_db` database. This is done through the MySQL shell and with the information provided from the `db/schema.sql` file._

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Create you `.env` file. (Example at `.env.example`).
3. Run `npm install` to download all dependencies.
4. Run `npm run seed` to populate sample data for your database.
5. Lastly, run `npm run start` to start your Express server and start exploring!
